Hello! My name is Aditya and I am an Electrical Engineer working in the AEC industry and a recent convert to the world of code!
I am currently learning Python, with focus on OOP fundamentals in order to create my own application within Django.
Along with that, I also like to dabble in a bit of data processing/analysis using Excel/PowerBI and hoping for a leg-up from Python for the same.
Feel free to contact me here.
